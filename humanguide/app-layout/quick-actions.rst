Quick actions
=============

The most common action for an app, the one that needs to be accessed quickly might be added as a `bottom edge <https://api-docs.ubports.com/sdk/apps/qml/Ubuntu.Components/BottomEdge.html>`__ action, accessed with a swipe from outside of the screen upwards.

You can add a new contact in the Contacts app swiping up:

Hint

The hint is used to let the user know that there is something worth trying at the bottom of the screen.

After opening an app, a hint with a text and/or an icon is shown:
