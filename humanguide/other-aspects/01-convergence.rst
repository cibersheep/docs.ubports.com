Main page stays as the main page on phones or on the left on bigger
screen devices. Additional pages on the phone, can be displayed at
variable sizes on the right on bigger screens.

Using touch a user can swipe or long-press on a list item to reveal a
contextual menu. Using a pointer (mouse or trackpad) a user can
right-click the item to reveal the contextual menu. Using a keyboard a
user can focus the desired item and press the MENU key to open the
context menu.
