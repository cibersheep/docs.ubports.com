Dialogues
=========

A dialogue is a way of informing the user about important notices or
letting them to complete easy single action on a current page.

Dialogues should be clear and concise. Using one color accent for the
main action (red for destructive actions, green for positive actions,
grey for neutral actions) and avoid ambiguous button text.

Examples: left: Download a file (old accent color) right: Delete a
contact (wrong use of color, confusing answers.

Let’s focus on the ‘Delete a contact dialogue’: Question: Are you sure
that you want to delete this contact? Answers: Yes (green positive), No
(red destructive).

This is a clear example of an ambiguous answer text we want to avoid. we
want to focus on the main action that is to remove the contact which is
a destructive action, therefore we will present the dialogue like:
